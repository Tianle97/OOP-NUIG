## In-class Quiz I

1. What makes a coder a Cowboy/girl coder?
A. Lack of proper testing during development
Comments:
    * The evolution of requirements is to be expected, the key is to know how to deal with it
    * Low redundancy is a positive feature, but as cowboy/girl coders tend to copy-paste large chunks of code and "stop as soon as it works", this is generally hard to attain
    * The OO paradigm is not prescriptive: there can be well-written and manageable procedural code as well.


2. What is _not_ a key attribute of complex systems according to Grady Booch?
A. These are all key attributes of complex systems

3.	Which of the following stages can be found in the Waterfall Model?	
A. Design
A. Implementation

4. What characterises an Agile development methodology?

6. Which definition best describes UML?
A. a notation for modelling software systems
Comments:
    * UML is a language for modelling the flow of programs: instructions cannot be written with it, so it cannot be a programming language
    * although both Java and UML flourished in the mid-1990's, they evolved along separate paths and UML applies to any OO language
    * If UML were a meta-language, it would mean that it can be used to describe how the Java language works. Although technically one could design a compiler or interpreter in UML, it still wouldn't provide a specification of the target language.

7. How should one interpret an 'is-a' (inheritance) relationship from the class ThinLizzy to the class MusicArtist? Do __not__ assume class names necessarily mean what they say.
A. Everything that is a ThinLizzy is also a MusicArtist
Comments:
    * Indeed, you shouldn't have taken the class names literally
    * Also, the question said both are classes, so one could not have been an instance of the other

8. aggregation is
* A. a particular form of composition
* A. a has-a relationship that does not assume ownership
Comments:
    * Two correct answers. Remember composition and aggregation are not synonyms
